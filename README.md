# Philippine-School-Enrollment-Data


# 📄About
This project is an interactive Excel dashboard that analyzes public and private school enrollment across the 17 regions of the Philippines for academic years 2010–2011 to 2020–2021. It focuses on Kindergarten, Elementary (Grades 1–6), and Junior High School (Grades 7–10). The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and originally sourced from the Republic of the Philippines — Department of Education.

# 🎯Objectives
- Explore the state of education in the Philippines by looking at student enrollment in Kindergarten and Grades 1–10.
- Identify regions with the highest and lowest enrollments.
- Observe enrollment trends across academic years and between public and private sectors.

# 📊Findings
- **Total enrollment is stable year-to-year**. Across the period covered, annual totals stay roughly in the 22.7M–24.0M range per academic year.
- **Large regional disparity (cumulative)**. Region IV-A (CALABARZON) has the highest cumulative enrollment (≈ 37.2M), while the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) has the lowest (≈ 4.59M).
- **Public schools overwhelmingly dominant**. About 234,732,803 of the 273,063,053 total students (≈ 86.0%) are in public schools across the dataset.
- **Early-grade decline observed**. Enrollment in Grades 1–3 shows a downward trend over the period — visible in the dashboard and computed totals.
- **Concentration in a few regions**. The top 3 regions (CALABARZON, NCR, Central Luzon) account for about 35.3% of total enrollment across all years.
